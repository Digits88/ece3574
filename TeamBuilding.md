# Introduction #

If you've got a project idea, let it be known here!  Just make a project entry like the one below, fill in some info, and see who's interested.

## Super Awesome Example Team Project Name ##

The idea would go here.  It'd be about something really cool, context-aware, and describe the general idea behind the project, and some of the key points that need to be done.  Sell it to your future teammates.  You want them just as interested as you are.

# Put Project Ideas Here #


## Game Involving Gravity ##

We are thinking about creating a game that would somehow involve gravity.  A user would navigate through a maze or a map and would encounter "guards" that would need to be crushed by flipping the phone upside down and letting objects fall onto them.  This is just an idea and we are completely open to new ideas.

## Sliding Picture Puzzle ##

This project would take pictures from the phone or the internet and create a 15-piece slider puzzle that can be solved with the touch screen. The app would store the completed photos, and the time it took to complete the puzzles. Other functionality could also be added.

## Close Anonymous Chat ##
A chat room for people within range of each other. Ideally, it should be completely anonymous.
User opens app, it searches for a nearby chat. Searching could be done one of two ways: (1) Have a central server respond with nearby chat rooms using GPS coordinates or (2) Use bluetooth to make/connect to a chat room nearby.

I think there are plenty of ways to expand on this app. It's just an idea for now, but if you're interested, let me know.

## Geospatial Notes ##
An application that allows you to post something like a sticky note to a particular GPS location.  Expansion on this idea would be to post notes for everyone to see (ie. public, if you're visiting Blacksburg make sure you visit this place), or only to people you allow (friends).  We could also make notes only show up if you're within a certain range of the note, possibly create a treasure hunt type scenario where you have to find the first note before the next note, etc.

This project will preferably be written in javascript with Appcelerator.
