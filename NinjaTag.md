# Description #

> Using GPS location, players who are "It" will know where to find other players and have to get close to them and complete some task to show recognition(to prevent random walk-by's). Once tagged that person will be notified that they are "It" and have to go out to find other players. Various other modes are being deliberated but this will be the basic framework of the game.

> The second aspect of this game will be using a server to host all the players and whatever other usefulness it will provide.  With these log on features it will allow the players to join a group or a global game depending on their preference.

> Another game mode we hope to implement is a gameplay similar to assassins. Each player would be given a target at random and then given a time window in which to "eliminate" that player. The catch is that as the player is going after their target they have to watch their back because another player might have them.
