# Overview #

Spark Hunter is an RPG for the Android platform. The goal of the game is to capture and train creatures called Sparks. These Sparks are used to battle other players. It uses GPS and other player's data to decide on Sparks you find.

# Gameplay #

Sparks are randomly found by roaming the real-world. The type of Spark you will encounter will vary depending on your location. You can fight and capture them. Fighting with Sparks will cause yours to gain experience and level up. Other players can battle your Spark if you are near them.

# Why It's Unique #

RPG that uses a combination of social and geo-located gameplay. It allows users to explore their real surroundings by physically walking around and bumping into Sparks. They can also locate and battle other Spark Hunters. The server connection allows them to record their progress and compare them to other users via leader-boards.

# Complexity #

The complexity in this project comes from various things. Since this project is a game, the majority of the complexity will come from the multi-player aspect. This includes battling each other, trading with each other, and any other form of communication with other players. Networking between individual phones and with a central server will be needed. Spark spawning algorithms will also have to be created so different locations and other conditions will result in different kinds of Sparks appearing.
