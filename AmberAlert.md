# Summary #

Amber-Alert is an application that consists of a set of security features that is supported by a response network in case of emergency.

The targeted demographics are children to young adults and their parents along with other social groups in which this application could be useful.

# Features #

**-Network**

The Amber-Alert network consists of a group made of members, primaries, and secondaries.

Each group can have any number of each category.

Ex. Child1 and Child2 are "members". Child1's parents are Child1's "primaries" and Child2's parents are Child2's "primaries." Child1's parents are Child2's "secondaries" and Child2's parents are Child1's "secondaries."

When members are within a desired range of each other, they join a group session that allows their primaries to view who they are with.

Each primary can at any time view the location of their respective member and any other secondary members that are in the same group session.

Ex. Child1 and Child2 are together. Child1's phone dies. Child1's primaries can view that he was last with Child2, Child1's last location, and Child2's current location.

-Listed below are a set of security features that alert primaries if their members should encounter several emergency scenarios.  Secondaries are alerted if a primary does not respond in an timely manner or a primary pushed the alert out to all secondaries in the group.
