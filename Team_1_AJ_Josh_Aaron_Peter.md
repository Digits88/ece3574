# Introduction #

Day to day task can get complex and overwhelming in a hurry. With our new innovative scheduler we aim to change all that. Our goal is to produce an app that will streamline the thought process of when we want to do something to actually doing it. By simply logging ones desired information into our app, we hope that this will allow people to be more efficient and productive with their time. Tentative features will include location alerts and reminders, time based reminders and alerts, calendar that integrates with other services such as Google calendar, and possible chat integration between other members using the app.

# Features/Creative #

We have some general features we plan on incorporating in this app from the very beginning.  These include gps based locations for the appointments you set up in your calendar (these could be added individually if that is a possibility). These gps locations could then be set to enact user specified options such as silencing the phone and checking into that location (similar to four square).  The app would also go into a quick add/edit mode during the event so the user could quickly add/edit assignments, reminders, or other basic information about the test.  We have also talked about adding a chat function that would open once class was over for discussion about that class. The chat feature along with some others we have are still general and fuzzy, they will be developed and discussed later as we gain a greater grasp on the actual complexity of this project.

# Complexity #

We believe this application will be complex and long enough for a semester long project. Depending upon the desired feature set, we could have to integrate both, GPS and Bluetooth into the application. With GPS and Bluetooth, we would have the added complexity of dealing with 2 context awareness features. For programmers that have never even compiled a Java program, this seems almost mind boggling. The added the benefit to leaving the project “open” for the moment, is that we can easily add small features each build cycle. For example, we might try for one build cycle to get the GPS up and running, and in the next cycle add a feature that automatically silences your phone when you reach your classroom or meeting.

# Conclusion #

We hope to provide users with a fast and convenient form of daily planning through our design of this scheduling app. By combining different facets of scheduling into a single app, and adding features that complement real world scenarios, we will provide the best product possible. Because we are adding context awareness to our scheduler, we will be able to take a large burden off the user and instead place it on the app itself. The app will be able to take actions based on its location, making the life of the user much simpler. So by building a more robust software design, we will be able to accomplish our goals of simplifying the life of the user and making their day to day actions run smoother.
