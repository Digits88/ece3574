### Game Structure ###

To make this project with our own twist, the game will include a multiple amount of extra features along side it. The pictures that will be broken up into the fifteen puzzle will be found from several different sources. The client will be able to choose from several categories of pictures. These categories will include personal pictures stored on their phone, pictures of nearby places based on GPS coordinates, cities and towns that the client chooses to include, presidents and other historical figures, historical events, world flags, national monuments, etc. The pictures will be cropped and/or stretched to fit. We plan to get many of the pictures through access of pictures on people's phone and looking up each of the categories on Google. Other methods for obtaining pictures may also be added as new ideas are developed. In addition, features which are deemed unfeasible may be removed as necessary. Copyright may be an issue that we will try to deal with.

### Game Modes ###

The game will have difficulties as well. The client will be able to choose between modes like a certain amount of moves, the size of the puzzle, and even maybe a traffic jam type mode. In having certain amount of moves, there will be an easy, medium, and hard mode; where the user may have to do a puzzle in 30 moves when the puzzle can be solved in 15 or something of the sort. The size of the puzzle can consist of any size of row and column from 3x3 to 4x6 up to 8x8. The actual max size will be decided later. The traffic jam mode will consist of different sized pieces that will be moved around to solve the puzzle.

### Game Play ###

The user will also be able to solve the puzzle using one of two input methods. The first input method will be the touchscreen, which the user will use to move the puzzle pieces around with the tip of his or her finger. Alternatively, the user will be able to solve the puzzle using the phoneâ€™s accelerometer. This will be accomplished by holding the phone parallel to the ground originally and having the accelerometer simulate gravity to move the puzzle pieces around. For example, if the phone is tilted to the left, the piece to the right of the open square will slide left into the open square. The user will then not be able to move another piece until the phone is returned to the neutral position parallel to the floor.

### Educational Value ###

After the puzzle is solved, the client will be able to learn information, if able to, about the picture based on look ups by Google and links to Wikipedia. As well, questions will be asked. For example, if the picture was of George Washington, the game would ask you if you knew who the figure was through multiple choice, then would bring up information about his life and what he accomplished. Another example would be if the category was of the city of London and Big Ben came up as a picture, it would tell of the building of Big Ben and figures who have visited said figure.
