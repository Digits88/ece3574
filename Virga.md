## Overview ##
Virga is a sci-fi platform game that takes place on an unknown world. Commander Dako crash lands on this planet and is greeted with hostility. As he traverses this dangerous landscape to find his way home he must overcome obstacles.  Something Commander Dako is not aware of is the ever changing gravity on this unknown world.  As he battles enemies and destroys obstacles, his world could be turned upside down!

## Gameplay ##
What makes the game interesting is that it will incorporate physics and gravity in an intuitive way. The user will control Commander Dako and travel through a type of puzzle or maze. Obstacles will hinder the userâ€™s success in completing the puzzle and these can range from actual barricades to enemies.

## Features ##
Concerning the gravity implementation, the user will be able to control the gravity of the setting by flipping and rotating the phone. If the phone is flipped, various objects can fall. This opens up more ways to complete a level and adds an extra level of difficulty. There will also be variations in gravity causing the character to fall slower or faster.

## Implementation ##
Virga may feature an open source 2D game engine for the Android such as AndEngine, angle, or libgdx. We are also exploring the possibility of developing our own engine, suited specifically for this game. Using an open source engine allows us to focus on the actual development of the game and the gravity manipulation feature, and not worry about functions like graphics rendering or optimization.
