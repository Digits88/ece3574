# Introduction #

This is my wiki for the people-finder app.

For the first part of my project I will be designing a screen that will have a pressable button that will have the ability to open up to another screen. This will be the work for the set-up screen for once the app has started. The button press will be able to register the difference between a short and long press. Additionally, a drop down keyboard will be implemented to enter text into a text box.
